            <h3>3.1 Summary</h3>
            <p>
              Most Aeonx Digital web sites and some tools use "cookies," small pieces of data that can be read by a web server in the same domain that put the cookie on your hard drive. We may use cookies to help us retrieve your preferences and settings; help with sign-in; to combat fraud; and analyze site operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also use web beacons to help deliver cookies and compile analytics. These may include third-party web beacons, which are prohibited from collecting your personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
              You have a variety of tools to control cookies and similar technologies, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Browser controls to block and delete cookies</li>
              <li>Controls from some analytics providers to opt out of data collection in web beacons</li>
            </ul>

          <div className="subsection">
            <h3>3.2 Our Use of Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              Most Aeonx Digital web sites use "cookies," which are small pieces of data sent to your browser by a web server. Upon subsequent requests, your browser will send the cookie data to the same web server, or other web servers in the same domain, when accessing the web site. Cookies contain data that can be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. That data often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but may contain other information as well. Here is an example of a unique ID number stored in a cookie that Aeonx Digital might place on your device when you visit one of our web sites: 0aj17be34l7srju0qcdnftigt0
            </p>

            <h4>We may use cookies for:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Sign-in and Authentication:</strong> When you sign in to a site or service using your account on an Aeonx Digital web site, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. This is commonly referred to as a "session cookie". We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, your user name may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your user name to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Site Analytics:</strong> We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In addition to the cookies Aeonx Digital may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may also set certain cookies on your device when you visit Aeonx Digital sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties' web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties can set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services.

            <h3>3.3 How to Control Cookies</h3>
            
            <h4>Browser Controls to Block Cookies</h4>
            <p>
              Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies. Instructions for blocking cookies in different browsers are usually available at each browser's privacy statement or in their help files or settings pages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Aeonx Digital sites and services that depend on cookies. This will not stop you from being able to call in for support, however it can restrict the use of some tools for the support.
            </p>

            <h4>Browser Controls to Delete Cookies</h4>
            <p>
              If you accept cookies, you can delete them later. Instructions for deleting cookies in different browsers are usually available at each browser's privacy statement or in their help files or settings pages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies will be deleted and may need to be recreated.
            </p>

            <h4>Browser Controls for "Do Not Track" and Tracking Protection</h4>
            <p>
              Some newer browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites (or the third-party content on those sites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites' privacy practices. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Aeonx Digital does not currently respond to the browser DNT signals on its own websites or online services, or on third-party websites or online services where Aeonx Digital provides content or is otherwise able to collect information.
